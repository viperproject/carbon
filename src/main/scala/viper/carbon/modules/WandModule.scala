  /*====================================================================== General Note ======================================================================
    Statements being translated inside package statements are handled differently in two ways:
    exhaling: The permissions are exhaled from many states (the global current state, lhs state ...) instead of just one state.
    inhaling: Every state has a boolean expression (state boolean) that represents assumptions about this state and assumptions are added as
              conjunctions to these booleans (e.g., having a state 'Si' and its boolean is 'Bi', inhale x == 2 is translated as Bi = Bi & x == 2).
    Therefore, whenever a method is used to translate both statements inside and outside a package statement it will has the following parameters:
    statesStackForPackageStmt: A stack of states from which permissions can be exhaled during a package statement (instead of exhaling from only one state).
    allStateAssms: The conjunction of all state booleans of the states on states stack. Used in evaluating expressions and assertions.
    insidePackageStmt: A flag that indicates if the statement being translated is inside a package statement or not
    ==========================================================================================================================================================

                            // tempCurState. All Evaluations of expressions during translating the package statement take place in this UNIONState.
