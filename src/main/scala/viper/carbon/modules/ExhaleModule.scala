/**
 * A module for translating exhale statements.  The module takes care of the basic
 * structure of exhaling (like multiple phases) and exhaling boolean connectives
 * such as logical and or logical implication.  Other modules can register themselves
 * as [[viper.carbon.modules.components.ExhaleComponent]]s to perform the exhale
 * operation of certain expressions.
 *
 * The module also implements [[viper.carbon.modules.components.ExhaleComponent]]
 * and performs some default behavior for most expressions.

  /**
    * @param exp         the expression to be exhaled and the error to be raised if the exhale fails.
    * @param havocHeap   A boolean used to allow or prevent havocing the heap after the exhale.
    *                    For example, the heap is not havoced after the exhale when translating a fold statement.
    * @param isAssert    A boolean that tells whether the exhale method is being called during an exhale statement or an assert statement
    *                    (Assert reuses the code for exhale).
    *                    This is used for optimization purposes (remove extra operations if the statement is an 'assert')
    *                    and also used to translate the 'assert' statements during packaging a wand.
    * @param statesStackForPackageStmt stack of states used to translate statements during packaging a wand (carries currentState and LHS of wands)
    * @param insidePackageStmt      Boolean that represents whether this method is being called during packaging a wand or not.
    *
    * The 'statesStackForPackageStmt' and 'insidePackageStmt' are used when translating statements during packaging a wand.
    * For more details refer to the note in the wand module.
